/**
 * This package contains an example of the Strategy design pattern
 * implementation. The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms,
 * encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows clients to
 * choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, sorting algorithms are implemented using the Strategy
 * pattern. The application provides a Swing GUI that allows users to select an
 * algorithm, input numbers, and perform sorting operations while displaying
 * information about the sorting process.
